Docker Network
===============

=> Network is all about communication

=> Docker Network is used to provided isolated network for Docker Container

=> In Docker we have below 3 defult networks

			1) bridge
			2) host
			3) none

=> In Docker we have network drivers

1) Bridge  ---> This is default network driver
2) Host
3) None
4) Overlay ----> Docker Swarm
5) Macvlan


-> Bridge driver is recommended driver when we are using standalone container. It will assign one IP for for our docker container.

-> Host driver is also used to run standalone container but it will not assign any IP for container.

-> None means no network will be available for docker container.

-> Overlay network driver is used for Orchestration. Docker swarm will use this overlay driver

-> Macvlan network driver provide physical IP for container.


# Display Docker Networks
$ docker network ls

# Create docker network
$ docker network create Pankajit-nw

# Inspect Docker Network
$ docker network inspect Pankajit-nw

# Run Docker container with our network
$ docker run -d -p 9090:9090 --network Pankajit-nw Pankajit/spring-boot-rest-api

# Delete Docker network
$ docker network rm Pankajit-nw
