## What is an Application?

An application is a collection of programs that consists of three layers:
- Frontend (UI): Angular, React JS, Vue JS
- Backend (Business Logic): Java, .Net, Python, Node JS, PHP
- Database: Oracle, MySQL, Postgres, SQL Server, Mongo DB

## Application Tech Stack

Applications have multiple environments for testing purposes:
- DEV Environment: Developer Testing
- SIT Environment: Testing Team (QA) - System Integration
- UAT Environment: Client Side Testing - User Acceptance Testing
- PILOT Environment (Pre-Production): Testing with Live Data

## Application Architecture

The application architecture consists of three layers:
- Frontend (UI)
- Backend (Business Logic)
- Database

## Life without Docker

Without Docker, challenges arise due to software installations, version mismatches, and maintaining consistency across different environments.

## Life with Docker

Docker is a containerization platform that simplifies application deployment by packaging applications and their dependencies into containers.

## What is Docker

Docker is a containerization software that builds and deploys applications along with their dependencies, bridging the gap between development and deployment.

## What is Virtualization?

Virtualization involves installing multiple guest operating systems within a host operating system using hypervisor software. Each guest OS requires its own set of software.

## What is Containerization?

Containerization packages software and application code into a single container for execution, making deployment consistent and manageable.

## Docker Architecture

Docker architecture includes components like Dockerfile, Docker Image, Docker Registry, and Docker Container. Docker containers contain runtime processes for applications.

## Virtualization

Virtualization involves creating multiple guest operating systems within one host operating system. It requires installing all required software for each guest OS.

## Containerization

Containerization packages all software and application code into a single container. Containers include everything needed to run an application, making it easy to deploy consistently.

## Conclusion

Docker simplifies application deployment by handling dependencies. It's a containerization software that bridges the gap between development and deployment.
